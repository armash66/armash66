### About

Hi, I’m Armash.  
Engineering student and tinkerer.  

I like building small tools and experimenting with systems to see how they work.  
I enjoy backend logic, creating utilities, and taking projects from start to finish.  
Always coding, learning, and figuring things out along the way.
