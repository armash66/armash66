### About

Armash Ansari.

I’m a Computer Science student interested in systems, backend engineering, and applied machine learning. I spend most of my time trying to understand how software behaves beneath its abstractions — runtimes, data flow, and failure modes — because that’s usually where the real lessons live.

I like software that is boring in the best possible way: predictable, maintainable, and correct. I’m more interested in why something works (or doesn’t) than how impressive it looks in a demo.

These days I’m learning Go and Rust, reading open-source code, and slowly getting comfortable navigating issues, pull requests, and large codebases. I’m also studying backend system design and ML pipelines, with a focus on how models behave once they leave notebooks and enter real systems.

I tend to work on projects that are small enough to finish but deep enough to learn from. I iterate slowly, refactor often, and try to leave things cleaner than I found them.

Occasionally, something works on the first try. I don’t trust those moments.

I’m here to learn, build, break things carefully, and repeat.
