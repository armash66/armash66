# Armash Ansari

Computer Science student interested in systems, backend engineering, and applied machine learning.

I like understanding software beneath the abstractions — runtimes, data flow, and failure modes — and building things that value correctness and long-term maintainability.

Currently learning Go and Rust, exploring open-source by reading code and contributing where I can, and studying system design and ML pipelines.

I prefer small projects, deep learning, and steady iteration.
